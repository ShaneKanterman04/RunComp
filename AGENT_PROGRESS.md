# Agent Progress

## 2026-05-28

### Increment 1: Owner Route Coverage

- What changed: Added route-level tests for `/api/members` and `/api/exports` to verify server-side owner checks, explicit member-management store method calls, signed-in CSV export access, and owner-only JSON backup access.
- Files touched:
  - `GOAL.md`
  - `AGENT_PROGRESS.md`
  - `app/api/__tests__/members-route.test.ts`
  - `app/api/__tests__/exports-route.test.ts`
  - `jest.setup.ts`
- Tests added/updated:
  - Added 11 API route tests.
  - Updated `jest.setup.ts` so Node-environment route tests can coexist with jsdom component tests.
- Validation commands run:
  - `pnpm install`
  - `pnpm test -- app/api/__tests__/members-route.test.ts app/api/__tests__/exports-route.test.ts`
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm test`
  - `pnpm build`
- Known follow-ups:
  - Add route tests for invite generation and group goal owner checks.
  - Improve Settings/owner UX around backup/export and notification status.
- Skipped ideas:
  - Did not change backup data shape in this increment; existing store tests already verify sanitized exports, and changing backup semantics should be handled deliberately with migration/restore planning.

### Increment 2: Setup And Invite Route Coverage

- What changed: Added route-level tests for `/api/groups` and `/api/invites` to verify group creation sets the owner session, store validation errors are returned safely, race goal updates are owner-only, login links are owner-only, and invite tokens can only be created for runners in the current group.
- Files touched:
  - `GOAL.md`
  - `AGENT_PROGRESS.md`
  - `app/api/__tests__/groups-route.test.ts`
  - `app/api/__tests__/invites-route.test.ts`
- Tests added/updated:
  - Added 9 API route tests.
- Validation commands run:
  - `pnpm test -- app/api/__tests__/groups-route.test.ts app/api/__tests__/invites-route.test.ts`
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm test`
  - `pnpm build`
- Known follow-ups:
  - Add route tests for run logging/deletion/reactions and push subscription endpoints.
  - Move from route hardening into Settings UX polish once the critical API boundary coverage is less thin.
- Skipped ideas:
  - Did not change invite token behavior; current flow already uses signed, expiring tokens and the tests now pin the owner/current-group boundaries.

### Increment 3: Export History In Owner Settings

- What changed: Added local, per-group export request history for JSON backups and CSV downloads, then surfaced the last request timestamps in the owner Settings area.
- Files touched:
  - `GOAL.md`
  - `AGENT_PROGRESS.md`
  - `app/page.tsx`
  - `app/globals.css`
  - `lib/export-history.ts`
  - `lib/__tests__/export-history.test.ts`
- Tests added/updated:
  - Added 4 tests for export-history storage, corrupt data handling, and timestamp formatting.
- Validation commands run:
  - `pnpm test -- lib/__tests__/export-history.test.ts`
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm test`
  - `pnpm build`
- Known follow-ups:
  - Consider making backup/download success more explicit if exports move from browser navigation to fetch-based downloads.
  - Continue Settings polish around notification status and install/PWA status.
- Skipped ideas:
  - Did not add persisted server-side backup timestamps; local request history is simpler, testable, and avoids changing the file-backed data shape.

### Increment 4: Push Unsubscribe Hardening

- What changed: Scoped push subscription removal to the signed-in member so one runner cannot remove another runner's subscription by submitting an endpoint. Expired-subscription cleanup now uses the subscription's stored member id.
- Files touched:
  - `GOAL.md`
  - `AGENT_PROGRESS.md`
  - `app/api/push/route.ts`
  - `app/api/__tests__/push-route.test.ts`
  - `lib/store.ts`
  - `lib/push.ts`
  - `lib/__tests__/store.test.ts`
- Tests added/updated:
  - Added push route tests for authenticated save/delete behavior.
  - Added a store regression test proving another member cannot remove someone else's push subscription.
- Validation commands run:
  - `pnpm test -- lib/__tests__/store.test.ts app/api/__tests__/push-route.test.ts`
  - `pnpm test`
  - `pnpm build`
  - `pnpm lint`
- Known follow-ups:
  - Add tests around expired push subscription cleanup if the push sender gets easier to mock cleanly.
  - Continue notification settings clarity in the UI.
- Skipped ideas:
  - Did not add per-event notification toggles; the current push model is intentionally simple and the roadmap says to avoid expanding it unless the model already supports it cleanly.

### Increment 5: Runner Profile Empty State

- What changed: Improved runner profile modals with a compact run summary, 14-day activity count for active runners, and clear empty-state copy for new runners without achievements.
- Files touched:
  - `GOAL.md`
  - `AGENT_PROGRESS.md`
  - `app/page.tsx`
  - `app/globals.css`
- Tests added/updated:
  - No new automated tests; this was a narrow presentational copy/layout change using existing computed metrics.
- Validation commands run:
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm test`
  - `pnpm build`
- Known follow-ups:
  - Add head-to-head profile stats if it can be kept compact and tested cleanly.
  - Consider extracting profile summary calculations if more profile-specific metrics are added.
- Skipped ideas:
  - Did not add a new chart library or complex trend visualization; the existing streak strip already covers lightweight recent activity.
